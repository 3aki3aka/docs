# Class Profile Targeted Help

The Class profile page provides class details, access to its activities, and a menu bar of links for associated pages and actions. These links will vary from class to class depending on setup of class, course, and organization. 

The following are articles related to actions that can be done from this page:

- [How can an administrator print completion certificates for a class?](../tms-administrators/classes/schedule/print-completion-certificates-for-class-by-admin.md)
- [How do I assist my students with their labs?](../instructors/student-labs/assist-students.md)
