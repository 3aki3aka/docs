# Targeted Help for the Class Profile, Create Class, and Find Classes pages

## Class Profile
The Class profile page provides class details, access to its activities, and a menu bar of links for associated pages and actions. These links will vary from class to class depending on setup of class, course, and organization. They also vary depending on whether it is before, during or after the class is scheduled.
