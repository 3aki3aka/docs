# Class Roster Targeted Help

The Roster is a powerful page where you can view and manage student enrollments in your class. There is a summary area and a student list as well as different methods to add students to the class. It also has links to other related class pages and the classâ€™s details. 

The following are articles related to actions that can be done from this page:

- [How do I enroll multiple students?](../tms-administrators/classes/enrollments-roster/enroll-multiple-students.md)
- [How can I add an existing class's enrollments to a new event?](../tms-administrators/classes/enrollments-roster/add-existing-class-enrollments-to-new-event.md)
