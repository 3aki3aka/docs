# Are Labs Keyboard Accessible?

Labs are keyboard accessible using standard keyboard controls such as Tab, Space, and Enter.
 
 ## Labs with Virtual Machines 

If your lab is equipped with a virtual machine, there will be a selection of commonly used key combinations under the Commands Menu (lightning bolt icon) for ease of use. 
 
 ### Breaking Focus within a Virtual Machine

The virtual machine will capture keyboard input when focused. To send keyboard input to the lab interface and not the virtual machine, enter the keyboard shortcut **Ctrl+Alt+Break** to break from the virtual machine and return focus to the surrounding lab interface.
