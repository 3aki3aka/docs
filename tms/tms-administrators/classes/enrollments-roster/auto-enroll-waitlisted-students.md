# How do I automate enrollment of wait-listed students?

> :small_blue_diamond: Please be aware that functionality covered in this and linked articles may not be available to you.

You can set up your classes to automatically enroll wait-listed and requested students. This can assist you with managing enrollments to keep your classes running at maximum capacity. Auto-enrollment takes place when an enrolled student cancels their own enrollment, the class is at its maximum capacity and there are students in a wait-listed or requested status.  

Auto-enrollment is not activated when an Administrator cancels the student, only if a student cancels their own enrollment. When Administrators cancel an enrollment, they may select a replacement enrollment.

Auto-enrollment looks for wait-listed students and adds the student with the earliest enrollment creation date. If there are no wait-listed students, the system checks for requested enrollments to promote.

When auto-enrollment is in place, it affects all classes the organization owns, and is enabled on the **Organization** profileâ€™s **Preferences** tab under **Class Settings** by selecting **Allow Wait List Auto Enroll for Classes**.
