# How can I Stream a Class in the TMS using GoToMeeting? 

> [!Alert] Please be aware that not all functionality covered in this and linked articles may be available to you.

Give your students and instructors the convenience of one place for all members of the class to open their virtual classroom and all their course activities and labs. Deliver your Instructor-led training virtually with GoToMeeting within a TMS class.  

**Find your GoToMeeting URL**

Start by scheduling a meeting in GoToMeeting, when this is completed you can access the meeting’s URL to input in the TMS class. In the GoToMeeting set up, locate the meeting ID or the installation URL. Your meeting URL will read: https://global.gotomeeting.com/join/ + meeting ID without any dashes. If your meeting ID is 904-466-685, then the URL would be **https://global.gotomeeting.com/join/904466685**. This URL will log in your users without needing to input a code to enter the meeting. 

You may type in the meeting URL or find and copy the install URL. If you use the install URL you will need to replace the word “install” with “join” for the correct URL to input into your TMS class. 

**Enter your GoToMeeting URL in your Class**

If you have used the TMS before for classes, then the only new element is adding GoToMeeting for your class’ delivery. If you have not set up a class before, you can find links to additional resources below. 
1. On the **Create/Edit Class** page, expand the **Delivery** section. 
1. On the **Delivery Type** dropdown select **Virtual**. 
1. The Virtual Meeting Host menu appears below with **Custom Virtual Classroom** selected and a URL field displayed. Input your GoToMeeting meeting URL in the **URL** field. 

The TMS passes along the classId, studentLastName, studentFirstName, and studentEmail to the receiving site. 

BEST PRACTICE: Once a Customer Virtual Classroom URL is added the Enter Classroom button is available to students from their class enrollment, even before the class starts and after it is over. Therefore, it is best to use unique URLs for each class to avoid students from a class accidentally accessing another class they are not scheduled to attend.
