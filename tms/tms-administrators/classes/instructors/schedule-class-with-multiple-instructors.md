# How do I schedule a class with multiple instructors?

> [!Alert] Please be aware that not all functionality covered in this and linked articles may be available to you.

When you create a class, you can add one or more instructors to the class. One instructor will be marked as the primary instructor and will be displayed in the Find Classes output. You can assign different instructors to different classrooms (adding multiple classrooms is covered in the [How do I use multiple classrooms for a class?](../classrooms-equipment/use-multiple-classrooms-for-class.md) article).

To add multiple instructors:
1. Expand the **Instructors** section of the **Create/Edit Class** page and click **Add Instructor**. This will open the Choose Instructor dialog box. This dialog box is automatically filtered for instructors that do not have a schedule conflict with the sessions of the class and belong to your organization. It may also be filtered for instructors that are certified to teach the course.
1. Set or remove any filters necessary, including these three filters, and click **Search**. 
1. All instructors matching your criteria will be displayed. Click the ones you want to add to the class and click **OK**.
1. The first instructor added will be set as the Primary instructor for the whole class. To change this, click the **Primary** radial button for the instructor you want set as the primary. This will be the instructor displayed in the Find Classes results in the Instructor column.

When an instructor is added to a class they are also added to all class sessions; instructors can only see the class on their Instructor Calendar if they are added to class sessions. 

You can add/remove instructors to individual sessions. To do this: 
1. Expand the **Session Times** section and click **Edit** next to the session you want to change. 
1. Click the **Instructor** dropdown and check or uncheck the box beside the instructor(s) name(s). Select which instructor is **Primary** for that session. This does not have to be the same instructor that is primary for the whole class.
1. Click **OK**.

If you edit class sessions to remove an instructor from one or more sessions, you will see a link in the Instructors section **Add all instructors to all sessions**, clicking this link will add all the instructors listed to all the sessions. 

When you are finished creating/editing the class, click **Save**. If you have removed the automatic filter for schedule conflicts and one of the instructors has a conflict, you will be notified upon attempting to save. Click **Yes** to continue saving the class with the instructor conflict or click **No** to go back and change the conflict.
