# How can I use Webex in a TMS class?

> [!Alert] Please be aware that not all functionality covered in this and linked articles may be available to you.

Give your students and instructors the convenience of one place for all members of the class to open their virtual classroom and all their course activities and labs. Deliver your Instructor-led training virtually with Webex within a TMS class.  

**Find your Webex URL**

When you have completed scheduling a meeting in Webex you can access the meeting’s URL to input in the TMS class. Look up the meeting by name on your Cisco Webex site. Under Meeting Information, you will find the Meeting Link. Copy the URL provided. If you have not set a password for the meeting, your users can attend once the meeting has started without registering or entering a password.

**Enter your webex URL in your Class**

If you have used the TMS before for classes, then the only new element is adding Webex for your class’ delivery. If you have not set up a class before, you can find links to additional resources below. 
1. On the **Create/Edit Class** page, expand the **Delivery** section. 
1. On the **Delivery Type** dropdown select **Virtual**. 
1. The Virtual Meeting Host menu appears below with **Custom Virtual Classroom** selected and a URL field displayed. Input your Webex meeting URL in the **URL** field.

The TMS passes along the classId, studentLastName, studentFirstName, and studentEmail to the receiving site. 

> [!KNOWLEDGE] **<sup>1</sup>BEST PRACTICE**: Once a Customer Virtual Classroom URL is added the Enter Classroom button is available to students from their class enrollment, even before the class starts and after it is over. Therefore, it is best to use unique URLs for each class to avoid students from a class accidentally accessing another class they are not scheduled to attend.

**Creating User Accounts and Enrolling Students**

We have several methods of creating user accounts and enrolling students. The simplest method is to provide each student a training key; the key allows them to create a user account and enroll into class.

User accounts can be created manually or imported. Once created the users can be enrolled as a group into your class.
