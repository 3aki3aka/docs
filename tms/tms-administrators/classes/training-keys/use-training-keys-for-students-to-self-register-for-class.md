# How can I use training keys for students to self-register for a class?

> [!Alert] Please be aware that not all functionality covered in this article may be available to you.

Training keys can be generated for each class created and distributed to students to enroll into the class and, if needed, to create their own user account in the TMS. Some setup by the LODS team is needed to enable the ability for students to create user accounts. Please submit a Support ticket at [**https://lod.one/help**](https://lod.one/help) for information.

There are two types of training keys that can be used for instructor-led training: class enrollment keys and event training keys. This article only covers the first.

Class enrollment keys are unique to each class and each student will need a unique key to register. To create these keys:
1. Navigate to the **Class Profile**.
In the tool bar, click **Training Keys**.
1. On the **Training Keys** page, click **Generate Training Keys**.
1. In the message dialog, type the number of keys you want to generate (one for each expected student) and click **OK**. The training keys will be listed. 

If Class Vouchers were used to create the class, the link on the **Class Profile** page to access the keys will be **Class Training Keys**. This opens the Class Training Keys page that displays each **Voucher Code** and its associated **Training Key**.

You will need to provide a unique training Key to each student to allow them to register for the class. An easy way to do this is to export the training keys to a .csv file and email a key to each student. To do this will depend on whether you generated keys or used vouchers. 

For generated keys:
1. On the **Admin** menu, in the **Class Enrollments** group, click **Find Enrollment Training Keys**.
1. From the **Add filter** dropdown, add the **Class** filter.
1. In the **Choose Class** dialog, input part of the class name and click **Search**.
1. Select the class in the search results and click **OK**.
1. On the **Find Enrollment Training Keys** page, on the right side, click **Output Options** and select the columns you would in the results.
1. Click **Search**.
1. Click **Export** above the search results. All columns visible and their data will be exported to a .csv file in the sort order of the results.
1. Email a key to each student.

For vouchers:
1. On the **Class Training Keys** page, click **Export** next to **Class Vouchers**.
1. Email a key to each student.
