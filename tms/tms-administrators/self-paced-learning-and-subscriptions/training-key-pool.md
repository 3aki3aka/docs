# How can I user training key pools for self-paced learning?

Training key pools allow you to distribute keys to users for them to create self-paced course assignments. The pool gives access to one course, with multiple keys to distribute to different users. The user can take and re-take the training for as long as the course assignment is valid. This method is much more efficient than creating individual course assignments for each student if multiple course assignments are needed. With training key pools you can set the duration of access to content for students, designating that students have access to the course's labs for a limited amount of time.

Each key is unique and assigned to an individual user. Keys can only be used once by one user. A list of keys can be exported as a CSV file to accomodate distribution to your students. The training key pool keeps track redeemed keys displaying who redeemed a key and when it was redeemed. There’s no limit to the number of keys created, if the number of keys initially generated is insufficient, new keys can be created later and added to the same pool. You are not billed when keys are created, but will be invoiced when a key is redeemed creating a course assignment.

1. Set the **Content Availability**, this limits the duration students have access to the course. This can be set up to 180 days.
