# How can I use subscription training keys for self-paced learning?

> Please be aware that not all functionality covered in this article may be available to you.

Subscription keys are a method to automatically assign a subscription to a user. Keys are aligned to a subscription, and subscriptions allow you to group together multiple courses in one package to assign to students for a specified length of time. Students then have on demand access to the courses and can choose which content they would like to consume.
