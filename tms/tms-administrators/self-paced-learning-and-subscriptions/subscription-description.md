# What is a subscription?

Subscriptions deliver on-demand, self-paced training to your users through a set of courses. These courses are available to the user to take and retake an unlimited number of times within a limited time period. While a user’s subscription is active, they can select any course in the subscription catalog and immediately begin their training. Using subscriptions enables your users to work through the training they want, when they want it, without your staff having to manage individual course assignments.

There are several components to a subscription:

* **Subscription Profile** – A subscription is set up using a template called a Subscription Profile. This determines the available courses and the duration a subscriber has access to those courses.
* **Subscription Assignment** – Access to a subscription given to a specific person.
* **On-Demand Subscription Catalog** – A listing of all course available, where subscribers can select any course as self-paced training through a course assignment. The catalog automatically has bookmarks, and you can choose to display courses using tiles. Both filters and learning paths can be added.
* **Bookmark** – A placeholder to mark courses to access later. Bookmarked courses can be viewed from the Bookmarks link in the catalog or on the user’s Current Training page.
* **Learning Path** – A subset of courses within a subscription to direct user learning to a specific topic. Users can access learning paths from a link in the catalog.

Once you have created a Subscription Profile, you can assign subscriptions to users. The subscriber opens their assignment to a catalog of courses available to them. They can bookmark courses of interest, filter and search for courses, review learning paths for recommended learning on a topic and begin self-paced training on any course.

## Subscription Billing

Subscriptions are billed for each course assignment created through the subscription. Each time a subscriber starts a course, a course assignment is created, this is the billable event, it does not matter if they launch any activities. Each course assignment is invoiced for the month when it is created.

When setting pricing, be aware of the length the course assignment for the courses you add to a subscription and the duration you set on your subscription profile. The duration is the length of the user's subscription assignment; how long they have access to take the courses in the subscription. For example, if the courses entered in the subscription create course assignments that are available 180 days and your subscription duration is 180 days, then you will only be billed one time for each course that was started. However, if your subscription length is one year with courses are available for 180 days through course assignments, then you could be billed twice for the same course. If your user starts a course in the first month of the subscription, you are billed for it and it expires after 6 months; then in month 8 of the subscription if they take that course again you would be billed a second time for the same course.
