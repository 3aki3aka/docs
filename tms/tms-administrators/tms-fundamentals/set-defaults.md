# How do I set defaults for my site?

Creating users, classes, and courses have fields allowing organizations to choose their own default values. The default value automatically displays when you are creating a new entity, and each of these items can be revised as needed. You can set defaults through Organization Preferences.

To set your defaults:
1. On the **Admin** menu, in the **Organizations** group, click **My Organizations**. 
1. Select the organization **Name** to access the **Organization Profile**.
1. Click **Edit**. 
1. Open the **Preferences** tab. 

## Business Settings
You can set the days and times your organization is open, this displays when any user views your organization profile.

1. On the Organization profile's **Preferences** tab under Business Settings, check the boxes beside the **days** of the week you are open.
1. Once a day is selected, an **Open** and a **Close** field display. Click inside the field to view an Hour and Minute chart. Select the **AM** or **PM** times when your organization opens and closes. 

## User Defaults
Three defaults can be set for creating new user accounts: the User Password, the UserName Pattern, and the User Role(s). 

Organizations default to having the Basic User roles added for new users. You may have other roles added to all new users by default. If this is what you want, please submit a Support ticket at [**https://lod.one/help**](https://lod.one/help) to set up default user role(s).

| Field | Default Data |
|:------|:--------|
| **User Password** | Type a password for all new user accounts. The password must be at least 8 characters long. Your default password is applied to users created directly in the TMS or can be used when importing users. |
| **UserName Pattern** | Select either **E-mail** or **FirstName.LastName** |

## Class Defaults
Several defaults can be set for the classes you create such as the class capacity, the pattern of days classes are held, the start and end times for classes, and the status of the class.

| Field | Default Data |
|:------|:--------|
| **Class Minimum Capacity** | Set a minimum capacity to use as a search for classes you may want to cancel if the minimum number of students have not enrolled. To use this search criteria, go to **Find Classes** and filter by **Has not Met Minimum Enrollment**. |
| **Class Maximum Capacity** | Set a maximum capacity for classes. This restricts the total number of enrollments for your classes to the number you have set. |
| **Class Session Pattern** | Check the days of the week you normally want your classes to run. Class session will be scheduled on the checked days and skip the unchecked days. For example, if you do not hold classes on Saturday and Sunday leave those days unchecked, if you scheduled a 10 day class, by default, it will only be scheduled on dates falling on Monday - Friday.|
| **Class Session Start** and **End Time** | Set the class start and end times for your normal class day. |
| **Class Status** | Select from the dropdown the default class status. Please note, for class functionality to work the status must be set to either **Scheduled** or **Guaranteed to run** |.
