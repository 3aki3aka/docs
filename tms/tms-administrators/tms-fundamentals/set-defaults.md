# How do I set defaults for my site?

> :small_blue_diamond: Please be aware that functionality covered in this and linked articles may not be available to you.

Creating users, classes, and courses have fields allowing organizations to choose their own default values. The default value automatically displays when you are creating a new entity, and each of these items can be revised as needed. You can set defaults through Organization Preferences.

To set your defaults:
1. On the **Admin** menu, in the **Organizations** group, click **My Organizations**. 
1. Select the organization **Name** to access the **Organization Profile**.
1. Click **Edit**. 
1. Open the **Preferences** tab. 

## Business Settings
You can set the days and times your organization is open, this displays when any user views your organization profile.

1. On the Organization profile's **Preferences** tab under Business Settings, check the boxes beside the **days** of the week you are open.
1. Once a day is selected, an **Open** and a **Close** field display. Click inside the field to view an Hour and Minute chart. Select the **AM** or **PM** times when your organization opens and closes. 

## User Settings
Three defaults can be set for creating new user accounts: the User Password, the UserName Pattern, and the User Role(s). 

Organizations default to having the Basic User roles added for new users. You may have other roles added to all new users by default. If this is what you want, please submit a Support ticket at [**https://lod.one/help**](https://lod.one/help) to set up default user role(s).

| Field | Default Data |
|:------|:--------|
| **User Password** | Type a password for all new user accounts. The password must be at least 8 characters long. Your default password is applied to users created directly in the TMS or can be used when importing users. |
| **UserName Pattern** | Select either **E-mail** or **FirstName.LastName** |

## Enrollment Settings

Enrollment settings allow you to add a late cancellation time period and text. When a student cancels their own enrollment, you can have a a pop up message appear letting them know their cancellation is considered late and you can add a message about your late cancellation policy.

| Field | Default Data |
|:------|:--------|
| **Set window on Late Cancellation warning when student cancels an enrollment** | Input the number of days before class starts that qualifies as a late cancellation. | 
| **Late Cancellation warning text** | Type in the late cancellation information you want to relay to a student when they late cancel their enrollment. | 

## Class Settings
Several defaults can be set for the classes you create such as the class capacity, the pattern of days classes are held, the start and end times for classes, and the status of the class.

| Field | Default Data |
|:------|:--------|
| **Use basic class editor** | Check the box to enable the basic class editor if you would like to only view the essential fields when creating or editing a class. All fields are still available when the **Advanced Settings** link is clicked. |
| **Class Status** | Select from the dropdown the default class status. Please note, for class functionality to work the status must be set to either **Scheduled** or **Guaranteed to run**. |
| **Class Minimum Capacity** | Set a minimum capacity to use as a search for classes you may want to cancel if the minimum number of students have not enrolled. To use this search criteria, go to **Find Classes** and filter by **Has not Met Minimum Enrollment**. |
| **Class Maximum Capacity** | Set a maximum capacity for classes. This restricts the total number of enrollments for your classes to the number you have set. |
| **Use Event Training Key for self-enrollment** | Checking the box to use event training key enables the Event Training Key on all newly created classes. |
| **Class Session Pattern** | Check the days of the week you normally want your classes to run. Class session will be scheduled on the checked days and skip the unchecked days. For example, if you do not hold classes on Saturday and Sunday leave those days unchecked, if you scheduled a 10 day class, by default, it will only be scheduled on dates falling on Monday - Friday.|
| **Class Session Start** and **End Time** | Set the class start and end times for your normal class day. |
| **Enable Class Notifications** | Checking the box to enable class notifications defaults all newly created classes to having notifications enabled. |
| **Enable reminder message when a classroom has not been added** | Enabling a reminder when a classroom has not been added will pop up a reminder message anytime you save a class that does not have a classroom. |
| **Allow Wait List Auto Enroll For Classes** | Enabling auto-enrollment causes students in a wait-listed or requested status to be enrolled when an enrolled student cancels their own enrollment for a class at maximum capacity.

| **Show Instructor Certification Filter** | When creating or editing a class and adding an instructor, the Instructor chooser dialog can be set to add the Instructor certifications filter by default. Certifications can be set on an instructor's user profile to show which courses they are qualified to teach. Adding the filter when choosing an instructor will only show instructors who are set as certified to teach the course. |
| **Show Organization filter to choose instructors from outside my organization** | When creating or editing a class and adding an instructor, the Instructor chooser dialog can be set to add the organization by default. Adding the filter when choosing an instructor allows you to select from organizations you have access to. |
