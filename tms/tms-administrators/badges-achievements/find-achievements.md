# How do I find what achievements and/or badges my students have earned?

> Please be aware that not all functionality covered in this article may be available to you.

You can easily see what achievements and badges your students are earning from either a user's Achievements page or from the two search pages below. 

To access the Achievements page for a student:
1. On the **User Profile** page, click **Achievements** in the toolbar. This opens a page displaying all achievements and badges the user has earned. This link is only available if your organization has achievements enabled. If the user does not participate in achievements, the page will be empty even if the student has been manually issued a badge.

To track who has earned a specific achievement, use the **Find Users** search page. On this page:
1. From the **Add filter** dropdown, add the **Achievement** filter.
1. In the **Choose Achievement** dialog, select the achievement you want and click **OK**. All of your users who have earned the achievement will be listed in the results.

To see all the badges achieved by your students and the status of those badges:
1. Click **Find Issued Badges** in the **Badges** group on the **Admin** menu.
1. On the **Output Options** dropdown, select **Issued Status** and any other output options you want.
1. Add and set any filters needed and click **Search**.
