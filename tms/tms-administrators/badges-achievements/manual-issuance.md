# How do I manually issue badges for my students?

> [!Alert] Please be aware that not all functionality covered in this and linked articles may be available to you.

You may have badges that are not tied to achievements or whose requirements can be met by methods not monitored within the TMS. In these cases, you can set the badge to be manually issued and then you or your instructor can issue the badge from the class' roster, with the proper permissions. This provides you with flexibility in issuing badges.

To set a badge to allow manual issuance:
1. Navigate to the badge's **Profile** page.
1. Click **Edit** to edit the badge.
1. At the bottom of the **Basic Information** tab, check **Enable Manual Issuance**.
1. Click **Save**.

To manually issue a badge:
1. Navigate to the class' **Roster** page.
1. To the right of each student, in the row of action icons, click **Issue a Badge**. This will open the Choose Badge dialog and display only those badges that are set to be manually issued that you can access.

1. In the **Choose Badge** dialog, search for and select the badge you want to issue and click **Issue a Badge**. The button will briefly change to **Successfully Issued Badge** before closing the dialog.

To confirm the badge was issued, navigate to either the student's **Achievements** page or the **Find Issued Badges** page.
