# What is a Publishing Group?

A Publishing Group is set of courses that you grant access to other organizations for them to use for their classes and course assignments. You can have multiple publishing groups, each for a different purpose or audience without having to duplicate your courses for each group.

There are two types of access to publishing groups that can be granted:
1. Availability - this allows your sub-organizations to make their courses available through your publishing group for other organizations to use.
1. Published Organizations - this allows these organizations to consume the courses through their classes and course assignments. This is handled is handled through an authorization form with LODS in the same manner as was done for content providers. Organizations with this access are called Published Organizations. 

Published organizations are only able to have access to a particular course through one publishing group at a time. Therefore, Best Practice in creating publishing groups are as follows:

1. Create the publishing group (see [How do I create a Publishing Group?](create-publishing-group.md)).
1. Add the ability for sub-organizations to add their content.
1. Add courses (see [How do I add courses to my publishing group?](add-courses-to-publishing-group.md))
1. After an authorization form has been completed with LODS for an organization, add them as a Published Organization (see [How do I designate an organization as a Published Organizations?](add-published-orgs-to-publishing-group.md)).
