# How do I set up a course which allows class activities to be disabled?

You can control when and if students have access to class activities. Instructors can enable or disable any activity in a class they are assigned to teach, and Operations managers can disable activities in classes they manage. 

When a course is set up to allow class activities to be disabled, then all classes built on that course have activity disablement enabled. This includes all activities in the class, labs, external links (video, document and/or website), assessments, and SCORM modules can be disabled or re-enabled during class. 

> Please note: Surveys cannot be disabled.

The ability to disable activities must be set on the course or the Enabled check boxes do not show in the class. You can edit courses created by your organization. Vendors control features in courses contracted from them.

Activities need to be re-enabled for students to access them after class. You can activate a setting on the course which automatically enables all the class activities at the end of class in case an instructor forgets to re-enable any activities. 

To set up activity disablement:
1.	Find the course and open to **Edit**
1.	On the **Basic Information** tab, check the box **Allow activity disablement within classes**
1.	Check **Allow activities to be auto enabled after a class ends to ensure that all activities are available for student access after the class ends**
1.	**Save** your changes
