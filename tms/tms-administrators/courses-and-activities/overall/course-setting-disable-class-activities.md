# How to Setup a Course so that Class Activities can be Disabled

You can control when and if students have access to class activities. Instructors can enable or disable any activity in a class they are assigned to teach, and Operations managers can disable activities in classes they manage. 

When a course is set up to allow class activities to be disabled, then all classes built on that course have activity disablement enabled. This includes all activities in the class, labs, external links (video, document and/or website), assessments, and SCORM modules can be disabled or re-enabled during class. 

Note: Surveys cannot be disabled.

The ability to disable activities must be set on the course or the Enabled check boxes do not show in the class. You can edit courses created by your organization. Vendors control features in courses contracted from them. 

Activities need to be re-enabled for students to access them after class. You can activate a setting on the course which automatically enables all the class activities at the end of class in case an instructor forgets to re-enable any activities.
