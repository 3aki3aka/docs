# When can I edit a course?

Courses created by an organization are open for editing to users with course creation permissions. All fields, activities, and settings can be edited while no active training events are using the course. When a class is in progress or a course assignment is active, the course fields available for editing are limited. This limitation is in place to meet with Learn on Demand Systems billing procedure.

Editing a course profile is restricted when training aligned with the course is in progress. From the time a class starts or a course assignment is created and until access has ended, editing of the related course profile is restricted to the following:
* Course name
* Short name 
* Version
* Description
* Auto Archive
* Archive

If you edit a course with training in progress, a message displays stating: This course is currently in use for a class or a course assignment and some fields cannot be changed. If you need to update the course, we recommend using the Save As button to create a new version of the course for future deliveries.

To access all course features for editing, edit the course and select the Save As button. This creates a duplicate course profile and opens a dialog box to name the new course. The new course has all fields, activities, and settings open for editing; it can be updated and saved. For more information on cloning a course, [click here](/docs/tms/tms-administrators/courses-and-activities/overall/clone-course.md). Future deliveries of classes and course assignments can be created using the new course profile.

Changes needed for a class in progress can be made by cloning the course and making the needed changes. The class in progress can also be cloned, the course changed to the new course and saved. On the roster you can use the Add Students from Event link to choose the original class and add all those students as enrolled. 

In order to not be invoiced for enrollments of a class in progress that was replaced by a new class using the new course, you are required to contact Learn on Demand Systems Support the first day of class. We can cancel the class session on your behalf. Requesting cancellation of classes beyond the first day of a class or beyond course assignmentâ€™s creation date requires approval by your Account Executive.
