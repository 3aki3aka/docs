# How do I designate an organization as a Published Organization for my publishing group?

> [!Alert] Please be aware that not all functionality covered in this and linked articles may be available to you. 

For other organizations to consume your courses through their classes and course assignments, they must belong to your publishing group. 

Now that you have created your publishing group for a specific audience and have added it to your courses, the third Best Practice step is to add the published organizations. This is handled through an authorization form with LODS in the same manner as was done for content providers.

Once the authorization process has been completed,

1. Navigate to the publishing group and click **Edit**.
1. On the **Published Organizations** tab, click **Add Organizations**.
1. In the **Choose Organizations** dialog, search for and select the organizations that will have access to consume your courses through the publishing group and click **OK**.
1. Click **Save** to save the change.

> [!ALERT] Organizations are only allowed to have access to a course through one publishing group. Therefore, you may receive an error message: **[The organization] cannot be added because it already has access to one or more of the courses within the group from another Publishing Group.** If this occurs, please read [How do I find what courses belong to a publishing group?](pg-add-org-error-resolution.md)
