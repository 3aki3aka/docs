# How do I set up a course to enable assigning class activities to different students?

You can assign specific class activities to each student, enabling them to see and access their assigned activities while other students may see and access different activities. This is helpful for classes where sets of class activities should be completed by different students, like classes using a shared lab environment. 

A course must be set up for Instructor-led training and then any activity in the course can be set to assign manually to students; all activity types can be set to manual assignment. When the course is used to create a class, operations managers and instructors can manage the activities to assign or unassign them to one or more students within the class. 

Only students assigned an activity can see or launch it. If an activity is not assigned to any students, then no students will see it. Newly assigned activities display to students within a few seconds, while removed assignments may take up to 25 seconds to be expunged. If the student launched the activity prior to removal, a message displays, stating: Sorry, you donâ€™t currently have access to this activity. Please see instructor.

*Process to manually assign class activities to students.*

Setting manual class activity assignment for students is a different from the [disable class activities feature](/tms/instructors/instructor-prep-and-classes/disable-class-activities.md), which an instructor uses to disable an activity for all students in their class, but the activity is still visible to students. 

## Steps to enable manual class activity assignment

### Course set up
1.	From Site Administration on the Courses tile, select **Find Courses** to open the search page.
1.	Search for and select the course to open the course profile.
1.	Click **Edit**.
1.	On the Basic Information tab, verify the **Available Instructor-Led** box is checked, this enables manual assignment settings on the course activities.
1.	Open the Activities tab, each course activity set to Availability **Everyone**, has a check box for **Assign to Students Manually**, check any activities you want to have assigned by the instructor. Any activities not set to be manually assigned automatically display to all students.
1.	**Save**.
