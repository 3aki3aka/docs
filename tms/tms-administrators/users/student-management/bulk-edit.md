# How do I update multiple user accounts at once?

You can update user account information for groups of users with our Bulk Update User Profiles tool. This increases your efficiency; you no longer need to update the same information for users individually. You can choose multiple users to make changes on their user profiles to some fields, as well as, add roles, add organization management, or disable accounts. You can also flag fields forcing the users to update those fields before they can take any other action in the platform. 

## Update user information fields 

You can update several fields for multiple users.

1. From Site Administration on the Users tile, select **Bulk Update User Profiles**, this opens the Edit Users page.
1. Click on **Add Users** to open the Choose User dialog.
1. Search for and select all the users you wish to update and click **OK**.
1. To update the Company, Account Executive, or Organization for your users, under the **Change** heading on the **Basic Information** tab, select the **Choose** link beside the desired field to open a Chooser dialog, search for and then select the item from the search results and click **OK**.
1. To update time zones, under the **Change** heading on the **Basic Information** tab, expand the **Time Zone** drop down and select a time zone for your users.
1. Click **Submit**.

## Add roles or organization management

New roles or organization management can be added to multiple users. Organization management is not needed for students or instructors, but is necessary for all administrative roles, like Operations Manager.

1. From Site Administration on the Users tile, select **Bulk Update User Profiles**, this opens the Edit Users page.
1. Click on **Add Users** to open the Choose User dialog.
1. Search for and select all the users you wish to update and click **OK**.

1. To update organization management for your users, open the **Organization Management** tab and check the box beside each organization(s) you want these users to manage.
1. Return to the **Basic Information** tab and click **Submit**.

## Disable users

You can disable users in the platform, this prevents users from logging in to the platform, but does not eliminate their user account.  

1. From Site Administration on the Users tile, select **Bulk Update User Profiles**, this opens the Edit Users page.
1. From the **Basic Information** tab, check the **Disable** check box.
1. Click **Submit**.

## Flag fields
Flagging fields forces users to make changes before they can access anything in the platform. When a user logs in or if they are in the platform when a flag is submitted, a dialog opens with the submitted field(s) asking the user to update the following information. They cannot proceed until information is submitted for each field.
