## Test a cancelled class notification
Testing a notification gives you the opportunity to verify that the notification sends when you want it to go out and does not send when you do not want it to go out. You can limit the impact by restricting the notification to only go out for one course.

Time trigger notifications are sent out at the top of each hour and trigger for any class within the previous 59 minutes. If your notification is set up to send a reminder 24 hours after class ends, you will need to schedule a class starting the today and check that the notification has been sent tomorrow. 

Open your Notification Plan, if you have disabled the notification you will need to add the **Enabled** filter on the Find Notifications page and filter by **Is not Enabled**.

To set up testing, begin by preparing your notification.

1. Open the **Courses** tab and select **Specify courses**.

1. **Save**.

Create a class.
