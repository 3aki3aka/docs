# How do I create a notification that is sent to students when they are enrolled?

1. Open notification plans, from Site Administration on the **Notifications** tile, select **Create Notification Plan**.
1. Input a name and description for the notification.
1. The trigger is when a studentâ€™s enrollment status is changed to enrolled. The Trigger Event is **Class enrollment enrolled**. Select it and click Add.
1. Add filters, for example you may want to set the Class Status to **Scheduled**, then nothing is sent for a class in another status.
1. Administrative users are the ones who can enroll students (unless you have self-enrollment enabled). The Triggered By is **Administrator**.
1. If this is only being sent to the enrolled student, then the To is **User**.
1. Fill in **From**and **Subject**. Add a **CC* as needed. 
1. Add **Calendar Integration** for the user to add an appointment for their class enrollment.
1. Uncheck **Enabled** until you are ready to test the notification.
1. Input your **text** with replacement text for the notification.
1. On the **Organization** tab, assign the organization(s) where the notification will be used.
1. If you wish to limit it the notification to specific courses, select them on the **Courses** tab.
