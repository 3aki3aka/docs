# How do I create a notification to be sent to administrators and/or students when a student cancels their own enrollment?

1. Open notification plans, from Site Administration on the **Notifications** tile, select **Create Notification Plan**.
1. Input a name and description for the notification.
1. The trigger is when a studentâ€™s enrollment status is changed to cancelled. The Trigger Event is **Class Enrollment Cancelled**.
1. Add filters, for example you may want to set the Class Status to **Scheduled**, then nothing is sent for a class in another status.
1. The student is the one cancelling the enrollment, making the Triggered by **User**. 
1. You may want two separate notifications, one for staff to let them know a cancellation has happened and one for the student as a confirmation of their cancellation and how they can reschedule. Or you can send the same notification to both the staff and the student. If the notification is only to the student, then the To is **User**. To notify staff, you can check **Organization Manager** and select the user role that should receive the notification.
1. Fill in **From**and **Subject**. Add a **CC* as needed. 
1. Add **Calendar Integration** for the user to add an appointment for their class enrollment.
1. Uncheck **Enabled** until you are ready to test the notification.
1. Input your **text** with replacement text for the notification.
1. On the **Organization** tab, assign the organization(s) where the notification will be used.
1. If you wish to limit it the notification to specific courses, select them on the **Courses** tab.

Notifications related to classes must have Enable Notifications checked to have them sent. 

To enable notifications on a class,
1. Edit the class and stay in the **Basic Information** section.
1. Select **Show Advanced Settings** in the top right above the section header.
1. Check the box for **Enable Notifications**. 

You can also add this as a default setting so that each class created has notifications enabled. To do this, 
1. Edit your **Organization** profile. 
1. Open the **Preferences** tab. 
1. Under Class Settings, check **Enable Class Notifications**.

## Test an enrollment cancelled by student notification

Testing a notification gives you the opportunity to verify that the notification sends when you want it to go out and does not send when you do not want it to go out. You can limit the impact by restricting the notification to only go out for one course.

Open your Notification Plan, if you have disabled the notification you will need to add the **Enabled** filter on the Find Notifications page and filter by **Is not Enabled**.

To set up testing, begin by preparing your notification.
1. Click **Edit** on the notification.
1. Open the **Courses** tab and select **Specify courses**.
1. Under the **Individual courses** heading, click **Add course**.
1. Search for and select a course named, **Testing Automated Notifications**, then click **OK**. If you do not have access to this course open a ticket to our Help Desk.
1. On the **Basic Information** tab, check the **Enabled** box. 
1. **Save**.

Next create a class.
1. Create a new class using the course set on your notification. 
1. Verify any notification filters you have set are set in the class. For example, if the Class Status must be Scheduled for the notification to send, then set your Class Status to Scheduled.
1. **Save** the class.

Create enrollments.
1. On the Class Roster, click the **Add Students** link.
1. Search for and select fake students or staff so that no one is sent a confusing notification, click **OK** to add the students to the roster.
1. Each student is added in the Enrollment status of **Enrolled**, modify as needed.
1. Click **Save** at the bottom of the roster to complete the enrollments.
1. Click on an enrolled **student's name** on the roster to open their user profile.
1. Click the **Impersonate** link to take action as that student.
1. Open the **Current Training** link. 
1. Beside their class enrollment, click the **Cancel** link.

Check for notifications.
1. Click the **Details** link in the top right corner of the page to return to the **Class** profile.
1. Click the **Find Sent Notifications** link to view all notifications sent for the class.

## Enable your notification

Once you have completed testing, you will want to enable your notification to put it in use.
1. Return to your **Notification Plan** to click **Edit** and open the **Courses** tab. 
1. To make your notification available for all courses used in your organization, remove the **Testing Automated Notifications** course and select **Applies to all courses**.
