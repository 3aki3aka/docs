# How do I create a notification to be sent to administrators and/or student when a student cancels their own enrollment?

1. Input a name and description for the notification.
1. The trigger is when a studentâ€™s enrollment status is changed to cancelled. The Trigger Event is **Class Enrollment Cancelled**.
1. Add filters, for example you may want to set the Class Status to **Scheduled**, then nothing is sent for a class in another status.
1. The student is the one cancelling the enrollment, making the Triggered by **User**. 
1. You may want two separate notifications, one for staff to let them know a cancellation has happened and one for the student as a confirmation of their cancellation and how they can reschedule. Or you can send the same notification to both the staff and the student. If the notification is only to the student, then the To is **User**. To notify staff, you can check **Organization Manager** and select the user role that should receive the notification.
1. Fill in **From**and **Subject**. Add a **CC* as needed. 
1. Add **Calendar Integration** for the user to add an appointment for their class enrollment.
1. Uncheck **Enabled** until you are ready to test the notification.
1. Input your **text** with replacement text for the notification.
1. On the **Organization** tab, assign the organization(s) where the notification will be used.
1. If you wish to limit it the notification to specific courses, select them on the **Courses** tab.
