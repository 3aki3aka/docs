# How do I share files with students?

It?s nice to share. And it's easy too. You can distribute files from your computer to your students through the lab monitoring tool.

1. In the TMS, click **My Calendar** at the top of any window. 
1. This will open up your Instructor Calendar. Find your class in the calendar, and click on the class name to open the **Class** page. 
1. Click **Monitor Labs**. 
1. A new browser tab will open up with all your class's active lab instances displayed. In the **Instructor Files** box, click **Share Files**. 
1. In the **Instructor Files for ...** dialog, click **Upload File**.
1. In the **Upload Instructor File** dialog, enter the **Display Name** for the files and click **Choose files**. 
1. Navigate to the file(s) you want, select it and click **Open**. 
1. Ensure the file(s) you wish to share are listed. Click **OK** through the steps to add the file(s).
1. After replication, ensure the file(s) you wish to share are checked and click **OK**.

A pop-up will appear in each student's launched lab, regardless of what virtual machine they are working on, informing them that a file has been shared by the instructor and how to access that file.
