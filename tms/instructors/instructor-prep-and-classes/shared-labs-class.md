* No post-class lab access is given for classes with shared or participant labs.

If this is setting is enabled, an awareness notice stating "TBD" displays to the instructor on the class page. 

As the instructor, you may still control when students have access to launch their activities by [disabling class activities](/tms/instructors/instructor-prep-and-classes/disable-class-activities.md). This setting must be enabled on the course to be available in a class. When used the class activity still displays with a message that the activity is disabled by the instructor. Access is disabled/enabled by
