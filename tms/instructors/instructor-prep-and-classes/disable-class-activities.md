# How to Disable Class Activities

You can control when and if students have access to class activities, including labs, external links (video, document and/or website), assessments and SCORM modules (Note: Surveys cannot be disabled).

Instructors can enable or disable any activity in classes they are assigned to teach, and Operations managers can disable activities in classes they manage.

All class activities are enabled by default. Instructors and Operations managers have a check box on each activity to disable or re-enable it; there is also a select all check box at the top of the activities list. 

> Please note: The ability to disable activities must be enabled on the course or you will not see the check boxes in the class. For more information, click here.)

Simply uncheck the Enabled box to disable the activity or check it again to re-enable it. Students see the activityâ€™s availability within 30 seconds. You can also check the Disable all activities box to disable all activities in the class.

Students have a Launch button for all enabled activities. Disabled activities appear slightly grayed out with a **Disabled by Instructor** message for students and the Launch button is not available.
