# How do I issue a badge to students in my class?

> [!Alert] Please be aware that not all functionality covered in this article may be available to you.

You may be asked to issue badges to students in your class. With the proper permissions, you can do this directly from your class' Roster page.


To manually issue a badge:
1. Navigate to the class' **Roster** page.
1. To the right of each student, in the row of action icons, click **Issue a Badge**. This will open the Choose Badge dialog and display only those badges that are set to be manually issued that you can access.

1. In the **Choose Badge** dialog, search for and select the badge you want to issue and click **Issue a Badge**. The button will briefly change to Successfully Issued Badge before closing the dialog.


You are able to issue a student more than one badge but only if they have not already earned it. If the badge has already been issued to them, you will receive an error message.
