# Lab Profile

Labs in Lab on Demand (LOD) are housed in a lab profile. The lab profile is where the settings are configured for the lab. These settings include (but are not limited to): Name, owning organization, expected duration, resource requirements, virtual machines, network configuration, and much more. Lab profiles can exist on their own or they can be part of a Lab Series that contains multiple lab profiles.
