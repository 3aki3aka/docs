# How do I get into my virtual classroom?

Adobe Connect provides our virtual classrooms in the TMS, and how you access it depends on whether you are a student or an instructor. 

Please find your section below to see when and how you can access your classroom. **Student must complete the pre-class preparation**.

As an instructor you can access the virtual classroom prior to class, but the amount of time before class starts is set by the organization running the class. It may be anywhere from 1 to 60 hours before class. 

A countdown timer will appear 48 hours before you can open the virtual classroom, showing how long it will be before the virtual classroom can be launched.
