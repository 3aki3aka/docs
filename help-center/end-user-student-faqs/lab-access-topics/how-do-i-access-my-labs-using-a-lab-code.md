## How Do I Access My Labs Using A Lab Code?

Some of our organizations give out lab codes or training keys to unlock access to labs for their users. If this is the case, as a student who has been given a code to access your labs, you should also have received a URL for the site where you will log in or create your user account. The login page for the site you are given will have a place to input a username and password and it will either have a “Create a user account” link  or a ”Register with Training Key” field. Directions differ slightly depending on which items you see.  

If the site you accessed has a link to Create a user account, then click on it, fill in all the fields to register and click Save. This will open a Current Training page, on which you will click the link to Redeem Training Key. Input the code you received and click the Redeem Training Key button. It will return you to the Current Training page with your course added. Click on the course name and your labs will display under the Activities section. Click the Launch button beside the lab you want to use.  

If the site you accessed has a field to Register with Training Key, then input the code you received and click Register. Fill in all the fields to register and click Save. This will open your class Enrollment page, and your labs will display under the Activities section. Click the Launch button beside the lab you want to use.  

Once you have an account and have redeemed your Training Key, you will no longer need the lab code/training key to login. You will simply logon with your username and password at the same URL as before. This will open the Current Training page, you will click on the course name to return to your labs.
