## Why Can't I Find My Completed Labs?

### If you canâ€™t find your labs on your **Current Training** page, they will be on your transcript. 

1. **Click the My Transcript** link at the top of the page and under the appropriate (Classes or Course Assignments) section.


### If you wish to access the labs again:

1. **Click the name of the class** or the **Course Assignment** you completed. Then under Activities click the Launch button next to the lab you want to use.

Once you have taken a class or have completed a course assignment, you can access the labs for a limited time afterwards depending on the type of course. If there is no Launch button, the labs have expired. You will need to contact your training center for an extension if you still want access to the labs.
