## How do I access my labs for a class using a lab code if I have a user account?

Some of our organizations give out lab codes or training keys to unlock access to labs for their users. If have been given a code to access your labs, you should also have received a URL for the site where you will log in.  If you do not have a code or have not been given credentials to log in please contact your learning organization.
