## API Client
A .NET API client library is available via Nuget. This will allow you to use the API using only .NET code. 

https://www.nuget.org/packages/LearnOnDemandSystems.OneLearnLOD.OneLearnLODAPIClient/ 

Example:

```
var apiUrl = "https://labondemand.com/api/v3";
var apiKey = "YourKeyGoesHere";
var labId = 12001; 
var firstName = "Sample";
var lastName = "Student";
var userId = "sample.student@nowhere.net"; // you can use any value that will uniquely identify the user in your system. here, we use an email address.
var email = "sample.student@nowhere.net";

var client = new LabOnDemandApiClient(apiUrl, apiKey);
var launchResponse = client.Launch(labId, userId, firstName, lastName, email);

if (launchResponse.Result == LaunchResult.Success)
{
    var url = launchResponse.Url; //this is the URL to send the user to
}
else
{
    var error = launchResponse.Error; //this will explain what went wrong
}
```
