# Lab on Demand API v3.0

## API Request Format

Requests are not case sensitive. Requests can use either **GET** or **POST**. 

A typical API request will look like:

`https://labondemand.com/api/v3/[method]?[parameters]`

For example, a request to get the entire lab catalog will look like:

`https://labondemand.com/api/v3/catalog`

## API Key
- All methods require an API key, which must be obtained from Learn on Demand Systems. This key is used by Lab on Demand to validate your account. The key can be passed either as an HTTP request header or as part of the URL.

    `HTTP header name: api_key`

- The key can also be included in the URL, directly before the method name:

    `https://labondemand.com/api/v3/[key]/[method]?[parameters]`

- The catalog example would then look something like:

    `https://labondemand.com/api/v3/123456789/catalog`

>[!ALERT] You do **NOT** need to provide the key as both a header and as part of the URL. You can pick whichever approach works best for you. Thoughout the documentation, the URL approach will be used for the sake of simplicity.

## API Response Format

## API Client
A .NET API client library is available via Nuget. This will allow you to use the API using only .NET code. 

https://www.nuget.org/packages/LearnOnDemandSystems.OneLearnLOD.OneLearnLODAPIClient/ 

Example:

```
var apiUrl = "https://labondemand.com/api/v3";
var apiKey = "YourKeyGoesHere";
var labId = 12001; 
var firstName = "Sample";
var lastName = "Student";
var userId = "sample.student@nowhere.net"; // you can use any value that will uniquely identify the user in your system. here, we use an email address.
var email = "sample.student@nowhere.net";

var client = new LabOnDemandApiClient(apiUrl, apiKey);
var launchResponse = client.Launch(labId, userId, firstName, lastName, email);

if (launchResponse.Result == LaunchResult.Success)
{
    var url = launchResponse.Url; //this is the URL to send the user to
}
else
{
    var error = launchResponse.Error; //this will explain what went wrong
}
```
