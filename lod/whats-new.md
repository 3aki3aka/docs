# What's New in Lab On Demand

## **Released June 26, 2020**

**Lab Latency**
- Lab instance average latency now filters out outliers that could skew the overall average of the latency value displayed in the lab client, as well as lab instance details pages. 
- Lab instance and lab instance connection history pages now show the latency deviation for that lab instance. Lab instance deviation is the standard deviation of all recorded latency values for the lab instance. A high standard of deviation indicates an inconsistent and potentially unstable network connection. 

**Azure CSS Improvements**
-  Lab instance details pages now show the cloud subscription instance that the lab used. Additional details are available for the subscription, including subscription state, pool, cloud subscription ID, enrollment account, state last changed, created and Azure management group. This will assist with management and administrative tasks.
- CSS Subscription pools Now have search buttons to view lab instances and Cloud Subscription Instances that are associated to the subscription pool.

**LTI 1.3**
- Deep linking is now generally available for use with Canvas and Blackboard. Speak with your Account Executive to help determine if your LMS is LTI 1.3 compatible.

**LOD Improvements and Fixes**
- Cloud Slice labs will now launch an interstitial page to help with resizing and relocation if opened in a window or tab that cannot readily be resized or moved. 
- You can now search for API Consumers by specifying which lab series are available to them using the Available Lab Series and Available Lab Series Name filters.
- A note is now placed on the lab instance details page when the instance is canceled using the API cancel call.
- Fixed a bug that prevented enhanced users from saving a differencing disk to their organization storage.
- Fixed a bug that prevented a user with the proper permissions from being able to view lab tags that they have added to lab profiles. 
- Fixed a bug that caused an improper title to appear in the Network drop-down selector in the lab client.

- Fixed a bug that prevented IDLx sections with variable dependencies from showing/hiding in a Lab Manual. 
- Fixed a bug resulting in an error when a description is provided through an LTI 1.3 launch.
- Fixed a bug that prevented ACP enforcement on a lab profile with specific user permission configuration.
- Fixed a bug that caused an application error when viewing a lab instance for a lab profile where the cloud platform is changed on a lab profile while there are running lab instances. 
- Fixed a bug that would populate CSS settings on the Cloud tab when a lab was configured for CSS, changed to CSR and then back to CSS. 
- Fixed a bug that prevented Expected Cloud Cost to be displayed when printing or exporting lab profile search results. 
- Fixed a bug that prevented labs from displaying when the lab profile is configured for French language.


## **Released May 29, 2020**

**Lab Instance Transfer**

- When permitted, students, instructors, and lab developers can transfer their lab instance to one another using email. This setting can be turned on at the organization level. LOD administrators will also be able to swap lab instances between users using a Transfer console available through the lab instance details page.

**Lab Instance Time Extension** 

- When permitted, students and/or instructors can be allowed to extend their lab instance via the pencil icon next to the lab timer. When the icon is selected, they will be presented with a calendar to set the new expiration date for their lab. The maximum amount of time that the lab can be extended is configured on the Organization that owns the lab profile. Once a maximum extension time is set, a drop-down menu in the lab profile will have three options to select who can extend their lab. 

    The options consist of:
    - Not Allowed
    - Allow only instructors to extend lab expiration
    - Allow users to extend lab expiration (includes instructors)

**Activity Based Assessment (ABA)**

- There is a new ABA option for both Question and Automated activities that allowsÂ  page navigation to be blocked until the student answers or completes the activity correctly. This feature will be very beneficial for challenge based lab scenarios.

- Fixed a bug that prevented multiple answer ABA activities from displaying properly in a task list. 

**Evaluations**

- When creating or editing an Evaluation, there is now a setting labeled Allow Skipping. By default, Evaluations will allow skipping, but it is now possible to disable the option to skip an evaluation, by unchecking the Allow Skipping setting.

**Improved Error Messaging** 

- We have updated error messaging to better indicate why a lab cannot be launched. The new messages include:
    - All available hosts have hit a launch throttle limit.
    - A host with sufficient RAM could not be found.
    - A host with access to all required virtual disk files could not be found.
    - A host with sufficient local storage could not be found.
    - A public IP address is not currently available.
    - A host with an available external container port is not currently available.

**API Error Console**

- A new console for tracking API launch errors is now available under the Lab Instances tile. This will allow LOD and organization admin to quickly identify the following issues that students may encounter when trying to launch a lab through the LOD API. Note the values in parentheses are only placeholders and will likely be different depending on the resources requested during the launch.
    - A host with sufficient local storage could not be found.
    - This lab is not currently available for launch via API. It is awaiting security review.
    - Sorry, you have taken this lab the maximum number of (3) times.

## **Released April 24, 2020**

**We are now LTI Advantage Complete Certified**

- LTI allows administrators to easily integrate labs into their existing LTI 1.3 compliant learning management systems.
In addition to more granular scoring and grading, LTI offers enhanced security utilizing OAuth 2 tokens and an improved authentication flow.

**Azure Cloud Slice Subscription (CSS)**

- There are now two variants of Azure Cloud Slice; Cloud Slice Subscription (CSS) and Cloud Slice Resource Group (CSR). CSS allows full access to an Azure subscription, to allow Azure training at the subscription level, rather than at the resource group level. This solution will be a functional replacement for Azure Passes for MOC courses. Cloud Slice Resource Group (CSR) has had no changes in functionality. For more information about CSS, read Enabling Azure Learning in the Post Azure Pass Era.

**Accessibility Enhancements**

Many accessibility improvements have been made to the lab client resulting in an improved experience for those utilizing assistive technology. Some of these enhancements include the following.
- Menu buttons are now 100% accessible using keyboard commands.
- Notifications, text fields, and status messages can now be announced by screen readers in real time.
- The colors used in Lab on Demand lab client  themes have been adjusted so that text is easier to read and differentiate from the background. All themes now meet WCAG AA guidelines.
	
**Lab Client Localization API Parameter** 

- Platform generated Dialogs, tabs, and menu items in the lab client can now be localized using the lang parameter during API launches. The available options include Chinese, English, French, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.

**Lab Instance Sharing**

- Lab instances can now be shared from the hamburger menu in the lab. This allows those with permissions to share their lab instance with another individual. When sharing, an email will automatically be sent out to the email address provided. Optional features may be extended from the original user's account such as saving differencing disks and editing instructions. The share can optionally be set to expire at a specified time and date. Additionally, the lab instance share can be protected by an established authentication provider.

**Virtual Machine (VM) Profile Improvements**
- VM profiles now display the hard disk capacity on the details page. 
- Lab developers can now create VM disks up to 2TB in capacity, this was previously limited to 256GB.

**Improvements and Fixes**
- When exporting a lab profile that uses a vSphere VM with EFI enabled, that setting will now persist when the lab is exported.
- IncreasedÂ security for authenticated launch links and introduced optional per user retake logic.
- Fixed a bug in the lab client that could prevent a lab from syncing with the server when the lab is configured for virtualization but does not contain any VMs.
- Fixed a bug in the lab edit page that prevented the minimum show time on Content URLs from being removed.
- Removed the validation warning when saving an Azure CSS lab without a Resource Group configured.
- Improved logic to require an Access Control Policy in Azure CSS labs when a user is given Contributor or Subscription Permissions.
- Updated tool tip in Cloud Subscription Pool Automation Settings.
- A column has been added to Lab Series details pages to identify the cloud platform that is being used in each lab profile. 

## **Released March 27, 2020**

**Lab Instruction Improvements**

- Lab instruction authoring has been improved to allow a function to show/hide lab instructions and lab instruction elements. Instructions and elements in Sections and code blocks can be shown or hidden based on the lab variable set via Life Cycle Actions, Activity Based Assessments, an IDLx textbox or an IDLx drop-down menu.
	 
- This can also work in conjunction with labs that use instructions stored in GitHub and displayed in the lab via a Markdown include. This allows the lab instructions to be displayed dynamically based on the variable set in the lab. For example, you could configure the drop-down menu to have 2 language options; en and fr. Then in GitHub where the lab instructions are stored you could create 2 copies of the lab instructions; one in English and one in French, with the lab variable value at the end of the file name. The lab user could then select en or fr in the drop-down menu in their launched lab, and the corresponding lab instruction file from GitHub would be displayed in the lab.

- Additionally, the variable can be selected with an API launch. This allows the lab to display a specific Section when the lab launches.

    - **Sections**: Sections are used to group lab instructions and elements together so they may be called up on and manipulated as one. This is done by assigning a lab variable that has been set via LCA, ABA, an IDLx textbox  or an IDLx drop-down menu.

    	> :::sectionName(variableName-variabelValue)

    	> section text or markdown elements

    	> :::

    - **IDLx Drop-down**: there is a new @lab token to add a drop-down menu to lab instructions, and assign multiple values to the drop-down menu. The values added to the drop-down become variables in the lab and can be assigned to IDLx sections as a way to show/hide lab instructions. The @lab token can be found in the @lab button when editing lab instructions or by using the syntax below.

    - **Dynamic Includes**: IDLx already supports displaying lab instructions stored in GitHub via a Markdown Include. That functionality has been expanded to use variables set in the lab to display lab instructions based on the drop-down menu selection. This requires the file names of the content in GitHub to have the variable value at the end of the file name, and a Section created in the lab instructions with a variable that has been set via LCA, ABA, an IDLx textbox or an IDLx drop-down menu.

        > **External repository file name**: 
        > 
        > `sample1-en.md`.
        >
        >**Include syntax with variable in file name**: 
        > 
        > `!instructions[(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user1/sample1-@lab. Variable (language).md)`
        > 
        > In this example, the variable value is `en` and the variable name is      `language`. 
    
    These are not limited to language selections. Lab variables, Sections and code blocks can be used to show/hide content based on the lab variable. Another use case for this could be Choose your difficulty, where there are multiple versions of the lab instructions with varying difficulty levels and the lab user selects their preference and lab instructions are displayed accordingly.

**Improvements and Fixes**
- Updated Instructions Import Page Title to reflect general usage of IDLx.
- The background color and foreground color in the lab client now meets the minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1. 
- Language now declared in HTML of Lab Client.
- Deprecated QR code for lab launches.
- Resource Template parameters are now preserved when cloning a lab using Save As or when a child lab inherits the cloud environment from a parent lab profile.
- Disabled API consumers will now be hidden on the lab series publish page.
- Tabs in the lab client now have an underline to show which tab is in focus.
- When launching a lab by clicking launch on subscription or launch on subscription pool, the correct dialog is now displayed.

## **Released February 28, 2020**

**Alt+Tab Shortcut Available in Commands Menu**
- The Alt+Tab keyboard combination is now available as a shortcut under the Commands Menu. This allows students to swiftly switch between two full screen applications in their lab instance. When switching between three or more applications, the shift key may be held while selecting the Alt+Tab shortcut to cycle through all open applications on Windows and select Linux virtual machines.

**Cloud Security Review**
- A Cloud Security Last Reviewed filter is now available when searching for lab profiles. The output will display the date and time that the last Cloud Security Review was completed.
- Access Control Policies can now be sorted by Requires Security Review.
- Never has been added to the list of available options in the Cloud Security Review Approval Expires filter when searching for lab profiles.

**Lab Variables Now Configurable by Lab Authors**
- Lab authors can now initialize lab variables from the very start of the lab. These can be used in Life Cycle Actions(LCA) as well as Activity Based Assessments(ABA). These variables are available in IDLx using @lab.Variable(name).

**Improvements and Fixes**
- Access Control Policies can now be sorted by Requires Security Review.
- Tooltips have been added to the Advanced tab of API consumer profiles, to describe the available options.
- Two new filters, Is parent of and Is child of, are now available when searching for organizations on Labondemand.com.

---

## **Released February 14, 2020**

**Save As for Access Control Policies and Resource Templates**
- It is now possible to create a copy of an Access Control Policy (ACP) or Resource Template (RT) from an existing ACP or RT, by clicking Save As. This behaves similar to Save As on a lab profile. This will provide the creation of policies and templates in a timely manner without having to manually enter the same settings. 
 
**Cloud Security Review**
- Lab profiles that use cloud orchestration are subject to a cloud security review. Until a review is completed, the lab cannot be launched via TMS, API, LTI, or other outside Learning Management Systems. The cloud components that are used in lab profile must be reviewed for any security issues, such as: Access Control Policies, Resource Templates. Additionally, any changes made to the lab profile's Cloud tab will cause the lab to undergo a security review again before the lab can be launched. 
 
**Events**
- Start and End times can now be defined for an Event. Labs are available to launch only during this time period.
This will allow us to exercise greater control over cloud and virtualization resources.
 
**Improvements and Fixes**
- Architectural improvements have been made to increase throughput, stability, and resiliency in the LOD Platform.
- Lab Profile RAM is now calculated to include overhead from NAT network after adding or removing RAM from a VM profile belonging to the lab profile.
- The network required for Linux ABA scoring is now properly created when launching lab profiles that inherit content.

## **Released November 22, 2019**

**Evaluation Star Rating Scale**
- A new option has been added to Evaluations, to allow the use of a star rating scale. 

**Theme Options**
- Lab on Demand has been updated with a universal theming engine. Instead of having separate theme settings for the lab client, authoring tools, and admin tools, one theme setting now applies to all areas of the platform. No matter where you set the theme, it will apply across the entire platform. This also means that all the themes previously only available in the lab client are now available in the LOD admin site.

**Improvements and Fixes**
- Cloud subscription details pages now have a Find Lab Instances link to search for all lab instances associated with the cloud subscription.

**Container Registry Accounts**

- Add any number of external registry accounts to LOD. This is useful if you have containers in a registry such as Docker Hub, and have multiple organizational accounts for managing your container images.
 
**Improvements and Fixes**

- Fixed a bug that caused an error to occur during lab launch, when the option in subscriptions to override subscription pool settings is disabled and use the subscription pool authentication settings instead. 
- Fixed a bug that could cause manually evaluated activities to be scored more than once. This issue did not impact automated ABA/PBT. 
- Fixed an issue that prevented some pages from being able to choose an organization when the organization profile had Assignable to Users enabled. 
- Fixed a bug that caused an application error when editing lab instructions of an AWS lab profile that does not have an AWS region configured.

**Persist Container Changes**

- Containers can now persist changes, similar to how differencing disks work for VMs. Changes can be persisted to a new container image, new lab and container image or the current container images in the lab can be updated. This allows lab authors to configure the container image and save it, so that the configuration will be present on future lab launches that use that container image.

**Container Registries**

- LOD now supports creating custom container registries that are linked to an external registry, such as a private Docker Hub repository. When persisting changes to a container image, you can choose to save the changes to the custom container registry. This allows you to use containers defined in any registry you have access to in your labs.

**Improvements and Fixes**

- Fixed a bug that prevented networks from being saved to a new lab, when cloning a lab and reusing containers.
- Fixed a typo on cloud subscription authentication tab.
- Fixed a bug that prevented roles from being removed that were created by a lab user in a lab.
- Fixed a bug that would prevent resource deployment errors from being logged to a lab instance.
- Fixed a bug that caused hybrid AWS and Hyper-V labs to be stuck loading during launch.

**Lab Client Improvement**
- The Lab client has been updated with memory optimizations for general stability and performance improvements.

**Active Lab Instances Search**
- A filter has been added to filter active lab instances by cloud platform.

**Fixes and Improvements**
- Fixed a typo on the tooltip for Introduction Content URL, on the Advanced tab of lab profiles. 
- Fixed a bug that caused an error to occur when printing search results from a container image search or a cloud subscription pool search. 
- Fixed a bug that prevented some fields from printing or exporting, on cloud credential pool search results.

## **Released August 16, 2019**

**Lab with No Menu Options**
- When no menu items appear in the Lab Clientâs main menu, the menu button will no longer be visible. This can happen when the lab doesnât allow Cancel, or Save.

**AWS Improvements**
- AWS Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) service is now available to use in AWS labs. 
- AWS lab user account names will include a lab specific unique identifier. This will enable better auditing of activity in AWS labs, particularly in exam scenarios.
- Support for Amazon CloudWatch Events and Logs in AWS Cloud Slice labs.


**Improvements and Fixes**
- Fixed a bug that prevented concurrent ABA to perform in AWS labs. 
- Fixed a bug that would cause the number of available cloud credentials to display incorrectly.
- Fixed a bug that prevented low availability emails from being sent when a cloud credential pool meets the low availability threshold.
- A bug has been fixed that prevented launching a lab as a non-administrator from an internal Lab Series Assignment.



## **Released August 2, 2019**

**Find Lab Series Assignment Output and Filter**

- There is a new filter and output option for Lab Series Organization.

**Enabled Bug Reporting Filter**

- When performing a lab profile search, there is a new filter to display labs that have bug reporting enabled.

**Cloud Subscription ID Filter and Output**
- There is a new filter and output to display the subscription ID in search results for lab instances and/or cloud subscriptions. This was done to help identify where a subscription is used in LOD. 

**In-Lab Notifications**

- Long notifications now allow scrolling. This was done to prevent the close button from being hidden when a long notification was displayed in a lab.

**Token Aliases**

The following items in LOD are now referenced by an alias instead of an ID, in replacement tokens. This was done to make items in LOD more flexible and import/export without errors.

- IDLx activities 
- Cloud Resource Groups
- Cloud Templates
- Cloud Credentials
- Cloud Portal Credentials

**Credential Pool Import/Export**
- When importing a lab that has a credential pool associated, the  pool will now be preserved on the new lab profile during import. 


**Cloud Resource Groups Selected by Default**
- When creating a child lab profile, cloud resource groups from the parent profile will now be selected by default on the child lab profile. 

**Improvements and Fixes**

- Fixed a bug that prevented filing a bug report from a launched lab.
- Fixed a bug that would cause importing to fail when importing a lab profile from an older version of LOD.
- Fixed a bug that would cause importing to fail when the lab contained replacement tokens. 
- Fixed a bug that would prevent blocking web request LCAs to replace tokens when sent in a post/put body.


## **Released July 19, 2019**

**Private Networking in Container Labs**

- Docker containers are now able to communicate with other containers in the same lab instance using a private network. A container network is configured the same way as a VM in LOD -- add a network from the Networks tab and make it available to the container on the Containers tab. 
 
**Deleting Lab Profiles**

- It is now possible to delete a lab profile that has lab instances associated with it. Preventing the lab from being deleted in this scenario isn't necessary, now that lab profiles aren't deleted from the database. 

**API Consumer Configuration**

- Configuration templates have been updated to allow Default Max Lab Instances to be modified on a non-custom API consumer configurations (Per Instance, Per Series Assignment, and Concurrent Usage).

**Azure Resource Deployment Output Data**

- Azure resource templates can now be configured to output data from Azure, back to LOD in the lab instance data. This data can be displayed in the lab via @lab replacement tokens. This is helpful in scenarios when a student needs to RDP or SSH into a VM in Azure, or when information is needed about a deployed resource such as a storage account.  

**Improvements and Fixes**
- Fixed a bug that prevented the lab extension timer from being extended by the configured amount.
- Fixed an issue that could cause a lab to not reflect recent changes made. This issue affected a very small number of lab authors. 
- Fixed a bug that prevented Azure cloud slice labs from deploying resources in the background and allowing the lab to display before resources were deployed. 


## **Released July 12, 2019**

**Docker as a Lab Fabric**

LOD is adding a new fabric, to run labs in containers. Currently data centers have lab hosts to run virtual machines, but we will soon be adding lab hosts to run containers. This release of Docker containers is for internal use only and will be enabled for the public at a later date.

- Docker will be configurable on lab profiles, in the same drop-down where you would select Hyper-V or vSphere. 
- The user experience will be similar to Linux SSH labs, where there is no desktop UI for the student to interact with. 
- Running labs in containers results in labs that can be launched much quicker than a traditional VM-based lab. 
- Running labs in a Docker container will be particularly exciting for Linux labs. Linux environments will be ready for student use in a matter of seconds, instead of minutes. This is because each Linux sub-system does not need to be loaded per lab instance, as most of the files needed for the lab are already running on the Docker lab host. 
- Containers enable Linux labs to perform similar to a Windows-based VM with improved mouse support. 

- Docker fabric v1 will include support for:
    - Load balancing across hosts
    - Lab save/resume support
    - Multiple containers
    - Split window support 
    - Activity based assessments (ABA). 
    - Life Cycle Actions (LCA)
    - ABA and LCA in containers use Bash for scripting and scoring. Refer to the [Activities documentation](https://docs.learnondemandsystems.com/lod/activities.md) for more information about Bash scripts.

**Exposed Ports in Docker Labs**
- Lab authors will now have the ability to reference host and/or port values independently of the overall address. Many applications reference addresses differently than the standard host:port syntax, so making the components available independently will allow maximum flexibility.
    - @lab.Container(alias).ExposedPort(exposedPortValue).Address 
    - @lab.Container(alias).ExposedPort(exposedPortValue).HostPort 
    - @lab.Container(alias).ExposedPort(exposedPortValue).HostName 

**Docker Resume Message**
- When a docker container lab is saved and resumed, the resume message now says  This shouldn't take long.

**Lab Display Delay and Custom Message**
- Lab profiles can now be configured with a time delay and a custom message, while the lab is loading. You can configured these options on the Advanced tab of a lab profile. This feature is available on all lab types in LOD (Hyper-V, VMware, Azure, AWS, Docker). This was done to provide a more seamless lab experience in labs when additional services are deployed when the lab is launched and are needed to be ready and displayed when the lab launches.

**Azure Lab Host Management Service Improvements**
- The Azure lab host management services has been updated with some improvements that will help improve performance, resilience, scalability and long-term maintainability. 
- Updated all API interactions to help cope with transient Azure service issues. 
- Moved to an Azure app service for better resilience, reliability and scalability. 
- Rebuilt on .NET Core, which will improve performance and maintainability. 

**AWS Improvements**
- AWS cloud subscription names now have a default prefix of Prefix-Platform Instance ID-Subscription ID. If a prefix is defined in the automation settings of a cloud subscription, the prefix will be appended to the default prefix. This was done to make subscription names more human readable, as well as helping to determine which account in AWS is associated with which cloud subscription in LOD.

**AWS Services**

- Support for additional AWS services have been enabled in LOD. These services can be used in labs that use AWS services.
    - AWS OpsWorks
    - AWS OpsWorks Configuration Management
    - AWS Secrets Manager
    - Amazon Athena
    - Amazon Cognito User Pools
    - Amazon Kinesis
    - Amazon Kinesis Analytics
    - Amazon Kinesis Firehose
    - Amazon Kinesis Video Streams
    - Amazon Route 53
    - AWS Step Functions
    - Auto Scaling Plans

**IDL (legacy) Exam Tab**
- The Exam tab has been removed from the lab profile editor. All legacy exams have been migrated to IDLx.

**Azure Cloud Subscription Improvements**
- Azure cloud subscriptions now have an option to enable billing reporting when editing an existing subscription or creating a new subscription.

**Improvements and Fixes**
- Cloud subscription pages now have a link to find lab instances for the subscription. This is helpful for determining the use of a specific cloud subscription within LOD. 
- Fixed a bug that would prevent a non-super user from being able to select Docker from the available virtualization platforms when creating a lab profile.
- Fixed a bug that prevented VMs from being cloned using Save As from a VM profile.

## **Released July 5, 2019**

**IDLx Improvements**

- Code Blocks have received minor changes. Clicking on the copy or type text icons trigger the expected behavior and clicking the code block itself will no longer copy or type text.

## **Released June 28, 2019**

**Improvements and Fixes**

- VMs that are not visible to the student but have the option for _Make lab instance data available inside virtual machine_ selected will no longer inject the username and password into the VM. This was done to prevent a hidden VM from being tampered with by the student. 

    ![](images/make-lab-instance-data-available-in-lab-highlighted.png)

- When a lab profile is deleted, it is now archived instead of purged from our platform entirely. This will preserve usage data, as well as speed up the deletion process. 

- Improved our host health check procedures to reduce the amount of time a student is stuck on the _connection lost_ screen after recovering from a network-related failure.

## **Released June 21, 2019**

**IDLx Improvements**

- Code blocks that contain multi line commands will now wrap to the next line, by adding `-wrap` when declaring the code block language. For instance `PowerShell-wrap`.

- Line numbers can now be added to code blocks, by adding `-linenums` when declaring the code block language. For instance `PowerShell-linenums`.

**Improvements and Fixes**

- Fixed a bug that caused @lab replacement tokens not to render in a lab when they were added to the lab instructions using a Markdown include from a GitHub RAW file. 

- Fixed a bug that caused users to be unable to be able to view subscription pool pages, unless they had a permission to view credential pool pages. 

- Fixed an issue that would cause some characters in a cloud credential to render as HTML. 

- Fixed a bug that would cause some developer files uploads to fail.

---

## **Released June 7, 2019**

**Improvements and Fixes**

- Fixed a bug that would prevent files from being deleted from a class after the instructor deleted the file from the Share Files section of the Monitor Labs page.

- Fixed a bug that caused the AWS region selection drop-down menu to display incorrectly on the virtual machine tab of a lab profiles, when using Internet Explorer.
