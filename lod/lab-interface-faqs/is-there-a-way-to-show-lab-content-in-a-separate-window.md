## Is There A Way To Show Lab Content In A Separate Window?

You can customize your lab workspace by moving all integrated IDLx and all IDL (legacy) content into a separate browser window. This window will contain all the lab content. This is especially useful if you have multiple monitors. The two windows communicate with each other, so all actions (machine switching, media loading, etc.) work just like they normally do. 

>[!alert] This feature is not available in IDL (legacy) labs where the manual is a resource (either as HTML or a document). In these cases, the resource has already been set to display using one of the following options by the lab developer and cannot be changed by you.

## To Separate Content In Another Window

**IDLx**

1. Click the hamburger menu in the upper-right corner of the lab interface. 

1. Select **Split Windows**.

    This will move the lab content; instructions, images, links, code blocks, etc into a new window. This window can be sized and positioned however you would like. 

1. When you want to **merge the lab interface back into one window**, click the hamburger menu in the upper-right corner of the window that contains the lab instructions.

1. Select **Join Windows**.

**IDL (legacy)**

1. Click the Options tab in the Navigation pane of the lab interface 
1. Select the checkbox for **Show content in a separate window**. 

    This will move the exercises, tasks, alerts, ideas, videos, and screen shots into the new window. This window can be sized and positioned however you would like. 

3. When you want to **merge the lab interface back into one window**, uncheck the box on the Options tab in the VM window.
