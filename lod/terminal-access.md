# Terminal Access to Virtual Machines

SSH Terminal access allows a user to connect and interact with a virtual machine from a terminal window.

There are several virtual machine (VM) requirements for SSH terminal access. 

- Install Hyper-V Integration. 
- Support ESX open-vm-tools. 
- A running SSH server on the VM (Hyper-V and ESX).

For more information about how SSH works, and instructions on setting up an SSH server, click [here](https://www.tecmint.com/install-openssh-server-in-linux/).

## Installation

1. **On Hyper-V**, install the Hyper-V Integration Tools.
    - Hyper-V Integration Tools can be downloaded [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55106).

1.  **On ESX**, Linux VMs must support the open-vm-tools package. On most builds, this is installed by default. It is recommeneded to verify this is installed using the following commands: 
    - On **Debian/Ubuntu** builds this can be installed with ```sudo apt-get install open-vm-tools```.
    - On **RHEL or CENTOS** ```sudo yum install open-vm-tools -y```.

## Configure a running SSH server. 

SSH configuration may need to be modified to enable password authentication or root login.

1. Open ```/etc/ssh/sshd_config``` and uncomment the line **_PasswordAuthentication yes_**. 

1. If you need root login as well, uncomment **_PermitRootLogin yes_**, or add the line if you canâ€™t find it. 

1. Make sure the SSH service auto boots. On most versions of linux can be done by entering the following command: ```sudo systemctl enable ssh```.

1. Start the service with the following command: ```sudo systemctl startssh```.

1. Once this is done, capture a differencing disk. 

1. In LOD, edit the lab profile and on the **Virtual Machines tab**, check the **_Connect to terminal_** checkbox for the VM you performed the above steps on.

1. Launch a new instance of your lab profile and verify the VM connects via SSH. The VM should boot to a terminal window, with lab instructions on the right side of the screen.
