# How Do I Extend The Amount Of Time On The Lab Timer?

Each running lab will have a timer in the upper right corner that shows you the amount of time left before the lab will be cancelled (if no activity performed in lab) or be saved and closed automatically (if saving is allowed for the lab). Most but not all labs can have their times extended. 

When there is less than 10 minutes remaining, a pop-up window will appear asking if you would like to extend your lab. Click **Yes** to extend the lab by 15 minutes.

>[!alert] It is not usually possible to extend your time when working in an exam, performance based test, or challenge.
