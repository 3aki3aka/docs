# Scoring

In Lab on Demand (LOD) there are multiple ways to score a student's performance in a lab. 

- [Activity Based Assessment (ABA)](#activity-based-assessment) (only available in IDLx)
    - Question and Automated activities
    - Partial scoring
- Scoring Bot
- Performance Based Training (PBT) - IDL (legacy)
- LTI 

## Activity Based Assessment

Activity based assement scoring is available in IDLx labs. To score a lab using ABA, configure an automated activity or question activity and give the activity a score value. Next, you should set the passing score for the lab. The passing score should be the sum of all activity scores. You may repeat these steps as many times as you would like, for more scored items in the lab. 

For more information on how to configure Automated Activities, see our [Activities Guide](activities.md).
