# How do I rename, move, or delete a folder or file?

In managing your storage, there may be times when you need to rename, move or delete a folder or file. 
- Renaming or moving a folder will change the location of the files that are stored in the folder. By default, any labs using a file within that folder are updated with the new location. 
- For a file that is changed, any lab using that file are updated with the new information. 
- In order to delete a file, the folder must be empty and the file not used in any labs.

## Rename a folder or file:
1. Navigate to the item in **Storage**. 
1. Click the item to be renamed to select it.
1. Click the **Rename** link under the item's icon. 
1. In the **Name** field, enter the new name. 
1. DO NOT uncheck **Update references**. Unchecking this box will prevent any references to the file from being updated with the new information.
