# How do I optimize my VMs for deployment?

Using the Start State feature will allow you to capture your Virtual Machines in the correct state for delivery to your end users. It freezes the state of your current lab so that each end user will get a copy of the lab in its current state.

To use Start States:
1. Finish all of your lab development 
1. Then click the **gear icon** in the top menu bar of the lab interface.
1. Click **Start State**. 
1. In the **Store Start State** window, select the Virtual Machines to capture and fill out the note describing what you are capturing. 
1. Click **OK**.

> ![KNOWLEDGE] You may get a pop-up note about **Dynamic MAC addresses**. Please consider what the message says before continuing and then click **Yes** or **No**.
