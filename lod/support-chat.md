# Support Chat

Lab on Demand has a support chat option on the Admin site, as well as in the lab client. Lab authors and learners can initiate a chat session with our Support team or submit a Support ticket.

The chat feature is enabled by default for all organizations, but it can be disabled if needed from the organization profile. Chat transcripts are stored in a support ticket, and a copy is emailed to the user.

## Admin Site

The chat feature can be found on the right side of the page on all Admin site pages.
