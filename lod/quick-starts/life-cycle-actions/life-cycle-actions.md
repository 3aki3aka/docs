# Life Cycle Actions

With the Life Cycle Actions feature, LOD is able to execute actions when specific events occur during the lab instance life cycle. 

These actions include:

- Sending a popup notification to the user
- Sending an email to the user
- Execute a subscription command
- Execute a machine command
- Send a web request

We will cover each of these actions, in a series of Quick Starts. We will discuss how to use each action, and when it is appropriate to use each one. After completing this Quick Start series, you will be able to configure your lab with Life Cycle Actions, to make your more lab a more rich experience for students.
