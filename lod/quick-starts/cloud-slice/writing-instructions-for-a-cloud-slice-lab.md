# Adding Instructions to Your Lab

Now that you have created a Cloud Slice lab, it is time to add instructions to that lab.

1. [] **Navigate** to the lab profile page for your Cloud Slice lab (you may be there already).

1. [] Click **Check Out** to check out the instructions for your lab.

    > [!KNOWLEDGE] You must check out lab instructions before you can edit them. As long as you have the instructions checked out, you are the only person who can modify them.

    Now that you have checked out your lab instructions for editing, you can edit them in the idl-md editor.

1. [] Click **Edit Instructions** to open the instruction editor in a new window, as shown below.

    The instruction editor consists of a markdown editor on the left, and a preview pane on the right. This gives you the ability to create lab instructions, and see a live preview in real time showing how they will be displayed to the user during the lab.
    
    > All Cloud Slice lab instructions are authored in an IDLx (Integrated Digital Learning eXperience) flavor of Markdown, called idl-md. This allows for easy plain-text authoring of instructions, with special syntax to used to decorate instruction text when you want it to be formatted differently in the rendered instructions presented to students.

    > [!KNOWLEDGE] Did you know that Markdown natively supports HTML, and HTML syntax can be used inline in the instructions you write in Markdown?
    
1. [] Now you're going to copy some sample instructions for use in your lab. Click ^INSTRUCTIONS[here](sample-instructions.md) to open sample instructions in a dialog window, and follow the instructions in that dialog.
    
1. [] Once you have finished experimenting with the markdown instructions, close the instruction editor.

1. [] Click the **Launch** button on your lab profile to launch it. You should see something like what is shown in the screenshot below.
