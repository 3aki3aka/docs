    > [!KNOWLEDGE] You must check out lab instructions before you can edit them. As long as you have the instructions checked out, you are the only person who can modify them.

    Now that you have checked out your lab instructions for editing, you can edit them in the idl-md editor.

1. [] Click **Edit Instructions** to open the instruction editor in a new window, as shown below.

    The instruction editor consists of a markdown editor on the left, and a preview pane on the right. This gives you the ability to create lab instructions, and see a live preview in real time showing how they will be displayed to the user during the lab.
    
    > All Cloud Slice lab instructions are authored in an IDLx (Integrated Digital Learning eXperience) flavor of Markdown, called idl-md. This allows for easy plain-text authoring of instructions, with special syntax to used to decorate instruction text when you want it to be formatted differently in the rendered instructions presented to students.

    > [!KNOWLEDGE] Did you know that Markdown natively supports HTML, and HTML syntax can be used inline in the instructions you write in Markdown?
    
1. [] Click INSTRUCTIONS[here](sample-instructions.md) to open a markdown sample in a new window.

1. [] Click in the markdown code block to copy the markdown sample, close the window, then paste the markdown into your instruction editor.    

    > Notice how the instructions are automatically rendered on the right side in the preview pane. This preview gives you an idea how the lab instructions will be displayed to students that launch your Cloud Slice lab.
