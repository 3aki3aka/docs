# Adding Instructions to Your Lab

//I wasn't sure which of the below two intro paragraphs I like better--[Option1] or [Option 2].  Your call.

[Option 1] All instructions are authored in Markdown. Markdown allows for easy plain-text authoring of paragraphs, with special syntax when you want certain items to be formatted differently. You can also use HTML alongside, or in place of, Markdown elements. The following sections describe various items used to create lab content with IDL v2.

[Option 2] Lab instructions are constructed using Markdown; an easy to use markup language to format text. Markdown was designed to be easy to learn as well as be easy to read and write. 

> [!ALERT] Did you know that Markdown supports HTML, and HTML syntax can be used in combination with Markdown?

>[KKNOWLEDGE] You must the check out the lab instructions before you can edit them. Checking out the IDL v2 lab instructions ensures that only one person at a time can make changes to the content.

Once you have checked out the lab instructions for editing, you are now ready to edit your lab instructions in the idl-md editor. 

2. While viewing a lab profile where you have already checked out the instructions, click Edit Instructions to open the instruction editor, as shown below. This will open a new window with an idl-md (markdown) editor on the left and a preview pane on the right. This gives you the ability to create lab instructions, and see a live preview of how they will be displayed to the user during the lab.
